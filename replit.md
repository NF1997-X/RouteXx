# Overview

This full-stack web application provides a robust data management system for tabular data. It features a drag-and-drop interface for creating, editing, and organizing table rows and columns with support for various data types (text, numbers, currency, images). Key capabilities include real-time statistics, an image gallery with lightbox functionality, and comprehensive CRUD operations for both table structure and content. The project aims to deliver a highly interactive and visually appealing data management solution with a focus on user experience and expandability, operating in three distinct modes: Table View, Edit Mode, and Route Management Mode with Google Maps integration.

## UI/UX & Features
- **Design**: Premium UI components, deep black dark theme, gradient backgrounds, blue accents.
- **Branding**: FamilyMart logo (Logofm.png/FamilyMart.png) with square shape (rounded-none) used consistently across all pages: navigation header (main table), custom table list, help page, custom table view, shared table view, loading launcher screen with animated orbital effects, and data loading overlay with rotating rings.
- **Loading Screens**: Logo appears instantly; loading progress animations take 5 seconds with animated progress bar (0-100%), dynamic status messages (Initializing ‚Üí Loading data ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Almost there ‚Üí Finalizing ‚Üí Complete), and random rotating tips (10 helpful feature hints that change every 800ms) for optimal user experience.
- **Navigation**: Streamlined single dropdown menu (grid icon) consolidates all navigation options (Saved Links, Custom Tables, Theme Toggle, Help, Edit Mode controls); saved share links auto-refresh list immediately after saving.
- **Quick Links**: Customizable quick access links in menu - users can edit URLs for "Share Link Page" and "Custom Page" via "Edit Quick Links" dialog; supports both internal paths (/share/abc) and external URLs (https://example.com); URLs stored in localStorage with validation.
- **Route Flags**: Active Filters section displays state/territory flags for regional routes:
  - üè¥ **Selangor Flag** (selangor-flag.png) appears for all SL routes (SL 1, SL 2, SL 3, etc.)
  - üè¥ **Federal Territories Flag** (kl-flag.png) appears for all KL routes (KL 1, KL 2, KL 3, etc.)
  - Flag icons replace standard filter icon in active filter chips with proper spacing (mr-1.5)
  - Flags dimensions: 16px √ó 8px (w-4 h-2) with object-cover for aspect ratio
  - Other routes use standard filter icon (üîç)
- **Saved Links**: Share links are auto-generated one-time when first created (both share links and custom tables); saved links modal provides Copy Link, Open Link (new tab), Edit Remark, and Delete actions.
- **Table Management**: Drag-and-drop rows/columns, editable "No" column for sorting, per-user layout preferences.
- **Button UX**: Clean opacity-based feedback for add image button (no loading spinner), maintaining disabled state protection during mutations.
- **Data Types**: Support for text, numbers, currency, images, and videos.
- **Media**: Enhanced media upload system supporting various image/video formats from gallery or URL, large file support (base64 data URLs), comprehensive video playback.
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API integration with lorry-optimized route calculation (distance, toll prices, traffic-aware optimal routing), customizable marker colors (hex code support with color picker), enhanced fullscreen map view.
- **Tutorial System**: Interactive, context-aware tutorial with premium UI.
- **Header Content**: Multi-page carousel for dynamic header content with CRUD operations.
- **Calculations**: AI generator row (Totals) dynamically calculates based on visible filtered/searched data; Kilometer column functional with cumulative distance calculation and total including return trip to QL Kitchen.
- **Animations**: Smooth page transition animations; staggered entrance effects on main page (navigation fade-in, content slide-up, header carousel, and table sections).
- **Compatibility**: 
  - Safari/iPad compatibility fixes for backdrop-blur effects
  - iOS DialogContent optimization (InfoModal, MiniMap & ShareDialog): safe area insets for notch/home indicator, dynamic viewport height (dvh), smooth touch scrolling (-webkit-overflow-scrolling), overscroll behavior containment
  - iOS input zoom prevention: minimum 16px font size on all input fields
  - Enhanced touch performance: optimized tap highlights, webkit backdrop filters
  - iOS modal improvements: proper height calculation accounting for iOS UI elements, touch-action pan-y for better gesture handling
  - Fullscreen map view optimized for iOS with safe area support and responsive height calculations
- **Delivery Alternate System**: 3-color power button system with intelligent day-based sorting:
  - üü¢ **Green**: On-schedule entries (Normal all days, Alt 1 on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun, Alt 2 on Tue/Thu/Sat) - opacity-60, sorted first
  - üü° **Yellow**: Off-schedule entries (Alt 1/Alt 2 on non-scheduled days) - opacity-60, sorted second (below on-schedule)
  - üî¥ **Red**: Inactive entries - full brightness (100%, no opacity reduction), sorted last at bottom
  - Automatic tier-based sorting: on-schedule ‚Üí off-schedule ‚Üí inactive
  - Edit mode uses compact dropdown (icons only: üü¢ green, üü° yellow for Alt 1 & Alt 2, üî¥ red)
  - 3-color system applies to ALL modes (regular view, shared view, edit mode)

  - **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD support - Create custom table from selected locations, Edit to update name/description/locations (add or remove locations), Delete custom tables from list page
  - **Navigation Structure**: Main table page uses Menu dropdown (Saved Links, Custom Tables, Theme, Help); Custom Table List page uses simple header with Home button only (no dropdown menu)
  - **Database Schema**: `custom_tables` (metadata: name, shareId, description), `custom_table_rows` (links to selected table_rows with cascade delete)
